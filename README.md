#Spiral Array

Practise code for injecting the capability of generating a clockwise spiral array into the Ruby Array class.
The solution in the code base is a recurrance based solution. Methods have been commented heavily for ease of understanding.
Specs are included within the spiral_array.rb file.

An example of a sample input and output is presented below.

```
1 2 3
4 5 6  => 1 2 3 6 9 8 7 4 5
7 8 9
```

Just for laughs, in the long run I intend to:
 * Convert this to a gem
 * Make a web app
 * Make an API
 * Any other remotely interesting idea that randomly pops in my mind


##Contributing

Though, the code was written for fun, if there is need for any functionality let me know and I'll gladly try my best to add the feature OR feel free to fork and commit.
